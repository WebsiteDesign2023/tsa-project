        <p> Trix is one of the main characters in our story and is definitely the leader in this trio. Trix is
        a non-binary bird. This teaches kids about gender equality and how anyone is welcome in the world. They moved to Manhattan
        not too long ago with Cedar and their parents. Trix is a bright and passionate Otter-Cat hybrid who lets
     their bravery lead them. Trix and Cedar have been friends since they were little, however Benjamin was late
    to join the party. Trix met Benjamin as they were waiting for cedar to get ice cream and saw what they
     would describe as “a small feather ball sitting alone on a bench.” They were a little surprised at their 
    apprehensiveness but got the impression that the city could be rather rough. After that night Trix and 
     Benjamin started talking and became good friends. All around Trix is an amazing friend and a kind role model.
      Everyone small and large will want to be just like them.
