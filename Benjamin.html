        <p>	Benjamin had spent his whole life in the city and knew it like the back of his talon. Growing up Benjamin was 
            a quiet bird with a lot to say. Benjamin never had an amazing relationship with his parents who were always at
             work. During the show you see the relationship between Benjamin and his parents and how it builds. Benjamin 
            is a smart bird who is straightforward and keeps everyone in check. He met Trix and Cedar at an ice cream bar
             and was very hesitant at first; he never had many friends and wasn't interested in making any. However he
              agreed to meet up with them and after a while the three became great friends. Benjamin is a smart and
             mature character that every child will love as much as they love the show.
