        <p>	Cedar came to Manhattan with Trix. She is a bear and the heart of the group while also being fairly laid back and 
            seemingly calm. Trix and Cedar have been friends since their childhood. Cedar has always trusted Trix but when
             it's time to venture out she always has her doubts. She's a kind bear that always offers to do stuff like 
             socialize and she is surprisingly well at it. Cedar met Benjamin at the same time Trix did acted a very 
             different way. At first cedar didn't want much to do with Koun. Although after a while Benjamin earned her
            trust. All together Cedar is a trusting and warm bear, children all over the world wait for the next joke
             that Cedar cracks.
